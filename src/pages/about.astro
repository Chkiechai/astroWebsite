  <h2>ChibiTea</h2>
  <p>Hiiiiii! I'm ChibiTea, a highschool student with a passion for Nuclear Engineering! My actual name is {identity.firstName}. I love food, cute fuzzy animals, (especially dogs, rabbits, and Japanese flying dwarf squirrels!) and settling down on the couch with a good book!</p>
<ul>
  {identity.hobbies.length >= 10 &&
    <li>Three of my main hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]}, {identity.hobbies[1]}, and {identity.hobbies[2]}</li>
  }
</ul>
<p>My skills are:</p>
<ul>
  {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
</ul>
Also, I almost forgot to mention I run an Etsy Shop (ChibiTeaDesigns), so feel free stop by and have a look!:D
