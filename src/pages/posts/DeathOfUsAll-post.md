### It All Starts With Learning Something New

On October 6th, 2025, I learned about Chernobyl, one of the worst nuclear reactor meltdowns in history. There were so many people were injured or killed, and hundreds of miles were polluted with radiation. Worst of all, no one was prepared, and word of the dangers of radiation was withheld from the public.

I became fascinated with learning as much as I could about Chernobyl and the effects of different levels of radiation on the human body. I researched facts about radiation for hours, until my browser had almost forty tabs open. I'm pretty sure I talked my family's ears off, I was so excited to tell them what I'd learned; everything from alpha, beta, and gamma particles to Acute Radiation Syndrome. I already knew lots of the facts I found online, since I'd taken a Nuclear Science merit badge in Scouting; and had bought several nuclear physics and technology books. But I also learned tons of new things, and it excited me.

But, while I was researching, I began to notice something rather frustrating and disheartening.

Among the scientific reports, (which I double and triple checked to make sure I wasn't being misled,) were too many blogs and articles about radiation that I can only describe as pseudo-science meets conspiracy theories. Things people truly believed were true, or just hadn't bothered to research and posted as reality.

They posted things that sounded somewhat reasonable unless you really thought about it. Things like *radiation can go through any object.* I knew, through my various books and accumulated knowledge from my research, that these 'facts' weren't true.

But I also realized that others might truly believe that they were true, simply because they had no real idea of radiation; it's always been seen and portrayed as an invisible force that cannot be stopped by simple means.

I needed a way to communicate the facts in an interesting way; and not only that, I needed to find a way to weave radiation into my book's narrative. What better way to do that than set the world in a nuclear fallout zone?

So, with an idea beginning to brew in my mind, I opened Libre Office and began to write.

### Keeping Realism Without Sacrificing Emotion

One of the things I struggled with while writing this book was keeping the facts true, but also keeping the narrative emotional. It's so easy to get lost in the details and the facts, and to over-inform the readers without gripping their attention.

But I had to keep my facts realistic; no mutants, no harnessing radiation for superpowers, nothing like that. While this book was set in a fictional narrative, its underlying science was as truthful as I could manage, given that some facts are just not available online.

I managed, though, and I evoked enough emotion while I was writing that even I started crying (a rare thing for me when reading *or* writing).

### Revising Myself

While writing *The Death of Us All*, I found out that I had also fallen prey to pseudo-science. Before I'd started researching, I'd believed that certain effects of a nuclear war would cause world-spanning radiation, massive firestorms, and cause the land to essentially turn into a desert wasteland. Really, thinking about it now, it's pretty cheesy, but back then I didn't know better.

When I discovered that things such as firestorms, while they could happen potentially in areas right by Ground Zero (where the bomb was dropped,) would not happen on a regular basis. The dropping of an atomic bomb would send a massive plume of ash, soot, dust, and fire into the air (hello, mushroom cloud?) and block out parts of the sky, just like lots of people imagine. But, while there is still an incredibly dangerous and lethal amount of radiation released onto the ground after an explosion, most of it is concentrated in the sky, where the ash and soot and dirt matter is.

That went against everything I'd ever heard or seen in a movie—things I'd taken as true simply because they were repeated constantly in these kind of mediums, and I could feel my mind fighting against the facts, resisting the truth, as it were.

I didn't want to find out that things I'd thought were true weren't actually.

But, I batted down my ego and fact-checked those new pieces of information. When I found out that they really were true, I 'revised myself,' so to speak. I couldn't allow myself to be ignorant just because the truth didn't align with my perception of the truth.


### Some Parting Words

I don't expect my book to change much in the realm of radiation knowledge. But, I do hope that those who read it will spread their newfound knowledge, because if they do, maybe they'll help to rid us of the conspiracies and false science surrounding radiation—and maybe that sharing of knowledge will cascade into other polluted subjects as well.
