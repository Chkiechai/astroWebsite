### About The Book

Six Hundred Years Ago,

The six Elemental Planes collided catastrophically Because of one greedy Mage.

Mages used to coexist peacefully with the normal humans, but since the Collision, Mages have been looked upon with hate and resentment.
Emerson Clearwater has grown up in a world where Mages are kidnpped, enslaved, and discriminated against.

When she manifests as a Soul Mage, she's bitterly disappointed. Then, a mysterious stalker appears with dire warnings, followed by a brutal attack by a monster. Emerson is thrown into a world of chaos and treachery.

With no help from the discriminatory police, sixteen year old Emerson must stop the culprit before its too lateâ€”or her beautiful city of Phoenix, Arizona, with become a mass grave.
