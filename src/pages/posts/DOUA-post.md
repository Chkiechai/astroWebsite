### About The Book

In a world where radiation dominates, how is survival possible?

Life is fairly normal for best friends Aubrey and Carlisle. Aubrey is fairly happy in her job as a Nuclear Medicine Technologist. Carlisle saves lives in one of Main's Chemo therapy clinics.

But good times never last long. When nuclear war comes, there's no warning for the general public. In only a few short hours, millions die. Aubrey and Carlisle are thrown into a world where radiation dominates, and nuclear winter beckons ominously. It's a world that is unforgiving and deadly, the toxins in the air lurking in invisibility.

This isn't a game. There are no mutants, no super-powers.

There is just disease, instinct, and the binding power of human empathy.
