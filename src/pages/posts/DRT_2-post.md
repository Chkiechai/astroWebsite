### About The Book

The Blooming Root Society.

Who are they? Their purpose is already known.

After the grueling battle with Dylan and his Anathema, Emerson and her team have been trying to uncover as much as possible about the Society. Unfortunately, besides the name, there haven't been anymore clues. Then a new drug starts appearing on the streets of Phoenx. It's somehow connected to the Society.

Stakes are getting higher, more lives are at risk. Can Emerson and her team do it?

Or will they fail when the world needs them most?
