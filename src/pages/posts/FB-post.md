### About The Book

Magic.

Daemons.

The world is not what it seems.


Every 50 years, a new Dulslayi is born, doomed to die.

Aislinn Ronde is content with her life working as a cashier at Starbucks and living in a nice apartment in Erie, Pennsylvania.

She's always believed she has strange genes. What else could cause her to have highly accelerated healing?

But it's not genetics. When a mysterious figure appears on her doorstep, Aislinn is thrown into a world of magic and secrets, where lies hide and wait, and daemons lurk. Love and betrayal, magic and hate. Death lurks around every corner. Aislinn is forced to face her desperate reality. 

Are her friendships true, or is everyone an enemy in disguise?

She has one month to uncover the secrets to her magic and find a way to survive. One month to master her newfound power before it's too late.
